1) The minimum for root finding using bisection is two root bracket guesses of opposite sign.
2) You can tell you have found a root when the root result is close to zero.
3) The root is never exactly zero, usually very small number near zero.
4) The basic bisection algorithm is:
	-guess 2 root brackets of opposite signs and keep narrowing down the guesses as close to zero as
	 possible until a root is found
	-precondition is a root in (a,b)
	-evaluate sign of the function at upper and lower ends of the interval
	-if a root doesn't result from this then it's an error
	-if a root results from this:
		--calculate the midpoint of the interval
		--evaluate the function sign at the midpoint
		--if the root is found then done
		--if root not found:
			---does the upper half bracket a root? yes- use midpoint as lower endpoint
							       no- use midpoint as upper endpoint
5) How to pick the enpoint root to change: if upper half of interval brackets a root, use the 
   midpoint as the lower endpoint. If not, use the midpoint as the upper endpoint. 
6) Newton and secant algorithms use one initial guess to refine and refine it to find the root.
7) An escape hatch is required to prevent infinite loops of finding the root.
8) In the newton method, a closed for expression for the deritvative is require but the secant
   method doens't.
9) Newton update equation: Xn+1 = Xn - f(Xn) / f'(Xn)
   secant update equation: Xn+1 = Xn - f(Xn) * ((Xn - Xn-1) / (f(Xn) - f(Xn) - f(Xn-1)))
10) For the 2nd guess of secant, it does not have to bracket the root, it is just used to calculate the slope
    unlike the 2nd guess of bisection which has to bracket the root. 
11) Newton doesn't require a 2nd guess because it uses the local slope of the function and the intersection
    of the x-axis to create an improved guess.
12) fabs() is used instead of abs() because it is for floating point numbers like decimals, whereas abs() is 
    used for integers.
13) We zero slope by comparing to atol because if you have a small number close to zero that begins 
    with 0.0... it will be incorrectly identified as zero. atol will account for all the numermical characters.
